### Houghlines
Like its name, it output any possible line found in image. This means that we need to find the rectangle ourself and it has a lot of possibility => post-processing is important but more complexity


### findContours
Unlike Houghlines findContour output all the shape its found with number of angle. So it's has no post-processing but the ability to the right rectangle is low but very easy
